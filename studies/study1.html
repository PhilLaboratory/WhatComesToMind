Using surveys</div><div>like the one you just completed, we are examining the factors that go into making social</div><div>decisions.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>How is this being tested?</strong></div><div>We have asked you to respond to stories or videos that differ on several important factors. By</div><div>isolating different variables that are involved in social thought, we can better understand how we</div><div>arrive at complex decision-making. For example, some actions are seen as more worthy of blame</div><div>if they are performed intentionally. Harming someone on purpose is generally worse than</div><div>harming someone by accident, or even harming someone in a way that is foreseen but not</div><div>intended.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>Main questions and hypotheses:</strong></div><div>A fundamental goal of our research is to understand the cognitive and emotional factors that</div><div>influence social judgment and decision-making. We are studying these factors by presenting</div><div>people with hypothetical questions that vary in specific ways and seeing which factors make a</div><div>difference. Some people filled out the same survey that you just filled out. Others got slightly</div><div>different surveys.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>Why is this important to study?</strong></div><div>By comparing answers on these important factors, we learn about what factors affect social</div><div>judgment. This has crucial implications for many public domains, including the legal system.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>How to learn more:</strong></div><div>If you are interested in learning more, you may want to consult the following articles:</div><div>Phillips, J., &amp; Cushman, F.
