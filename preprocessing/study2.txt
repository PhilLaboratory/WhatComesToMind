Preprocessing for study 2 consisted of manually extracting potentially relevant features from participant responses.
For each category, all features that were remarked upon by at least 2 participants were selected, along with additional features selected by the researchers which were expected to vary in their relevance to the category.
These features make up the feature list for each category.
